    <p>Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Pancake Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour. (<em>one and a half cup</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes. (<em>Three and a half teaspoons</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavour without making your pancakes taste salty. (<em>one quarter teaspoon, or more</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong> and <strong>butter</strong>: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes. (<em>one and a quarter cups of milk and three teaspoons butter, melted</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the barter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
        <li>Cook for two or three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>

    <h4>When to Flip Pancakes</h4>
    <p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.</p>
    <br/>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining barter.</li>
    </ol>
